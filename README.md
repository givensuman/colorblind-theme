# **moot**

## Call your methods with a moot point.
This theme is inspired by colorful and modern dark themes like One Dark and Monokai with an added effort to remove conflicting colors understood to cause eye strain, discomfort for dyslexics, and to overlap with Deuteranomaly and Protanomaly red-green colorblindness. 
Elements used more often on average in code are blue-tinted, with less frequent keywords easily noticeable but not overbearing with red-tints, and with elements typically adjacent purposefully distinct. You may notice heavily repetitive things like JSON are much easier on the eyes.
